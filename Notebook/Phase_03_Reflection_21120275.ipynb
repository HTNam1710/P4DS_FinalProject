    "\n",
    "- **Student name:** Huynh Cao Khoi\n",
    "- **Student id**: 21120275\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a reflection on my experience during the process of this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Difficulties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "During this process, I have encountered several difficulties below:\n",
    "- **Data collection:** \n",
    "\n",
    "With an open-topic project like this one, the data collecting process become a challenge, I have many ideas, but I cannot find enough necessary data to support them. Some data sources were limited by the policy, while other are not available for public. Also with other public datasets in Kaggle, they cover many topics, but not many of them are in my interst such as health, animals, nature world,... So after that, my team come up with this topic, the topic that I think is really important for someone who are new to the field of Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Preprocessing and understanding the data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - First of all, the size of this data is very large, this is the first I have to handle such a large dataset like this. The main issue come from the number of columns, there are 44 questions in this dataset, Most of them are multiple-choice question, and processing them like one hot encoding method make the total columns increase a lot (upto 296 columns). So the chanllenge here is read and find out the meaning of each columns, It just a take time step. Fortunately, the PDF file provided in the dataset folder was very helpful.\n",
    "    - Also, the preprocessing step is not also very easy, the current dataset are just divide in many fields, range, the column name doenn't have many meaning, so we have to do more in the preprocessing step to normalize and turn the data into more good and easy to read format.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Making meaningful questions:** \n",
    "    - This is the most challenging step, the dataset cover various topic, most of aspects of the current status of the data science fields, so to make a specific meaningful question in this context become more difficult, it was a struggle to see the relationship between each cols, how can they help me to dicover some thing inteseting that required for a further analysis?\n",
    "    - For my question, the current salary status, the tool set for each roles. They are all a very large question, and the relevant information is spray throughout the dataset, so the first thing I need to do is determine which columns are really needed? Does they contribute to my answer?  I also had to find the simplest way to present my ideas to ensure easy access to the information for everyone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **From myself:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - During the process of this project, I have encountered with the struggle while have to handle many things at the same times. I know this is a important time for everyone, not just me. The lack of time-management skills, and other skills too, also take me more time to determine what I should do next, which I should prioritize or how to finish my task in the best I can.\n",
    "## **What I learn from this project:**\n",
    "Those are what I have learnt while doing this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "- From the data: \n",
    "    \n",
    "    The topic is just a informative topic that I can more information about my career path. Through my analysis go along my teammates' analysis too, I get more information about what I should learn and what aspect I should focus in the future,..\n",
    "- Importance of teamworks: \n",
    "\n",
    "    Yeah, while working together, I know how important of the story-telling skills, how can i present and develop my idea in a effective way. Also how to collaborate with each teammate to come to a final result. I also learn from my teamates a lot, see how they find out and present their idea, and many other things. Thanks a lot my teammates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- More skills:\n",
    "I also get more and practice more skill in working with dataset, dataframe, also know how to go more into visualize the data and extract information from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What I can do next:**\n",
    "- About the topic of my questions:\n",
    "    For the answer of my question, I think that there are still lots of thing to do. While working in this project, I just consider the feature that I think is really important for my important. So the answers may not provide an overview point for the entire question, also the answer is limited in my knowledge scope. So if I have more time, I will get deeper to the dataset, try to get all the features to the best answer for my question.\n",
    "\n",
    "- About the skills:\n",
    "    With knowledge gained from this project, I can continue develop my skills, especially skills for presentation, collaboration, and programming skills (of course). Also, make a try to some interseting topic like Machine Learning is also one of my intend.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Cross - overview:**\n",
    "This section is about my review of my teammates' works, Trung Nam and Tu Nhi\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Trung Nam:**\n",
    "- **Interesting points:**\n",
    "    - His question is about some thing that is necessary for all of us, experience with programming languages skill.\n",
    "    - He also provides an interesting topic: an analysis of non-coding experience participants. This can provide us with interesting and perhaps unusual(up to now I can not beleive this situation really exists) information about the current career paths of participants working in data fields without using any code. It shows that there are many ways to pursue a data-related job without using programming languages.\n",
    "- **Strength:**\n",
    "    - Trung Nam demonstrates his ability to use different types of plots to present the results of his analysis. \n",
    "    - Also, how he find out new problems from the current one is also impressive. That is thing is so necessary, always asking new questions while solving the problem can lead us to an another interesting one. That make our analysis can be extended in many different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Weakness:**\n",
    "    I think there is some thing that he could improve to his analysis:\n",
    "    - More detail expalination: I think he could explain more about what he going to do, what is the purpose of his approach and why he choose this among many different ways.\n",
    "    - Notebook format: The current style could be improved by highlighting titles or questions to indicate the main content or purpose of each section. This would help readers keep track and ensure they don't miss any important information.\n",
    "### **Tu Nhi:**\n",
    "- **Interesting points:**\n",
    "    - Her question is such a broad question, which contains many aspects that we can consider and make a deeper analysis on this. Which the question `What is the state of Data Science in countries around the world?`, indicates her intention to give us a overview of the current state, that will not much focus on any aspect. Anyway, with a gerneral questions like that, let's see how she can access and answer it:\n",
    "        - She breaks down the problem into smaller, more specific questions about the factors contributing to the state of Data Science in a country, such as scale, company size, popular industries, labor workforce, and future potential (represented by the percentage of young people). between each countries, also gain much more information that we can expect.\n",
    "        - For each question, she identifies the most significant points and patterns in the data across countries and continents. We also gain much more insights from them.\n",
    "        - Finally, to get the final result, she use her own scoring range evaluate each country and determine the best one.\n",
    "    - About the plot, she use mostly the combination of bar plot and heatmap. About the heatmap, by the contrast of colors, we can easily observe the differences between each elements, also, the relationship between each factor can also presented clearly by equal size squares. Compare to stacked bar chart (thing that I mostly used in my analysis), the heatmap prevent the situation that one value have a large distance to another so the present of the plot will not good.\n",
    "- **Strength:**\n",
    "    - She show her good ability to frame the problem, identifying relevant questions or factors and breaking down the problem into smaller components. This skill is important not just in data science but also in problem-solving in our dialy life.\n",
    "    - Story telling is also one of her strengths. The process are described like a story, where she acts as an instructor and storyteller. While we travel to each section, we will gain more knowledge and in the end of story, the whole process was summaried so the whole picture of the story will be showned.\n",
    "- **Weakness:**\n",
    "    Up to now, her analysis is quite complete, also, with my current knowledge about the dataset, I cannot suggest any possible idea for her.\n",
